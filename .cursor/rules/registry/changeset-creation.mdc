# Proper Changeset Creation

## Overview
When working with changesets in a repository, it's important to handle them properly to support both monolithic and monorepo scenarios. This rule provides guidance on creating changesets correctly.

## Direct Changeset Creation
Instead of bypassing the interactive UI with commands like `yes | yarn changeset`, create changeset files directly in the `.changeset` directory with the correct format:

```markdown
---
"package-name": patch|minor|major
---

Description of changes
- Bullet points detailing specific changes
```

### Monorepo Example
For monorepos with multiple packages, include all affected packages in the YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
"package-a": patch
"package-b": minor
"shared-lib": major
---

Description of changes affecting multiple packages
- Change affecting package-a
- Breaking change in shared-lib
- New feature in package-b
```

## File Naming Convention
- Use the format: `descriptive-name.md`
- Names should be kebab-case
- Example: `add-authentication-feature.md`

## Change Types
- `patch`: Bug fixes and minor changes
- `minor`: New features, non-breaking changes
- `major`: Breaking changes

## Best Practices
1. Create one changeset per logical change
2. Include all affected packages in a single changeset
3. Write clear, descriptive summaries
4. Use bullet points for specific changes
5. Never bypass the UI in ways that could miss package dependencies

## Examples

### ✅ Correct: Direct Creation
```markdown
---
"ui-lib": minor
"api-client": patch
---

Add new button component
- Implement ButtonGroup component in ui-lib
- Update api-client to use new button types
```

### ❌ Incorrect: UI Bypass
```bash
# Don't do this
yes | yarn changeset  # Bypasses proper package selection
```

### ✅ Correct: Multiple Changes
```markdown
---
"web-app": minor
"shared-types": patch
"api-server": patch
---

Implement user authentication
- Add login/logout flows to web-app
- Update shared types for user session
- Fix API validation for auth tokens
```
