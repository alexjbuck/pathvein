    In this way it works for both pathlib.Path objects as well as third-party pathlib objects so long as they
    implement iterdir(), is_dir, and is_file() methods.

    This does not offer a sophisticated symlink following mechanism. If `type` is Path, this will short circuit
    to os.walk which provides better symlink handling capability.
